# Hi, I'm Aravind Kannappan 👋

I’m a Statistics master’s student at NYU with a background in sports analytics and machine learning. I’m interested in building production ML systems in domains like sports and healthcare, where decisions are time-sensitive and data is messy, high-dimensional, and constantly shifting.

I’m especially drawn to work that makes complex models reliable in real-world environments — whether that’s powering live analytics or supporting clinical decision systems — and I care about building infrastructure that teams can trust and iterate on safely.

## 🎓 Education
* **M.S. in Applied Statistics** (ML Specialization), NYU (2024–2026)
* **B.S. in Statistics** (Sports Analytics), Baylor University (2020–2024)

## 🔍 Interests
